# Kroyer

Kroyer is a program used to create random pictures from a set of rules in a grammar file.
It has barely any practical use cases, but can be fun to tinker around with.

## Inspiration

Kroyer is named after the old danish painter [P.S. Kr√∏yer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer).
The concept was inspired by Rexims randomart program ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer))
